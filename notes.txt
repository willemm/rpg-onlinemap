Websocket interface:

- join: Join the server.  Requires a token to keep out strangers
  Admin token enables admin mode, where you can create and edit pages
  The admin interface will create tokens for players

Admin:
- createpage: Create a new page
- editpage: Set stuff like title, etc
- uploadimage: For uploading the map on a page
- initiative: For setting the initiative list

Player:
- movepawn: Move pawns around the page (some can only be moved by admins)
- movearea: Create or move an area-of-effect marker


Flow:

DM goes to webpage and logs in with admin-token
DM creates (one or more) pages with a map and a number of players (todo: backend storage for different campaigns?)
Page creation also shows a player-token.  DM sends this token to the players
Players go to webpage and fill in token to log in (token in URL? Maybe security issue.  Do hash-tokens get sent to the server?)
Webpage shows one of the map pages to logged in players
Players can move player pawns and AOEs
DM can make different pages and push 'take players to this page' button
